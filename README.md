## Welcome to Etch A Sketch

Welcome to Etch A Sketch created by Aniekan Essiet

This project (or program) was craeted to test my HTML DOM manipulation skills with JS

You can pick any color of your choice then select the "COLOR MODE" to begin to etch

The "ERASER" button will erase the etched pixels, therefore returning it to its original state

The "CLEAR" button will clear the whole grid back to its original state as a new one all over again

Happy etching!!!
